    "The Challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number. The rules are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say \"OUT OF \n",
    "      BOUNDS\"\n",
    "    2.On a player's first turn, if their guess is\n",
    "       within 10 of the number, return \"WARM!\"\n",
    "       further than 10 away from the number, return \"COLD!\"\n",
    "    3.On all subsequent turns, if a guess is\n",
    "       closer to the number than the previous guess return \"WARMER!\"\n",
    "       farther from the number than the previous guess, return \"COLDER!\"\n",
    "    4.When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed \n",
    "       correctly and how many guesses it took!\n",
    "You can try this from scratch, or follow the steps outlined below. A separate Solution notebook has been provided. Good luck!"
